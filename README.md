# Billing-System

A First Attempt on programming a Billing System based on Zubu Ramen (A Ramen Restuarant that I am currently work part time at). 

The Program consits of Administrative, which they can Add/Edit/Remove an item from the database. Customers can Buy the Product from the list that is from the database. 

An implementation on the fstream library which creates a text file name "database", and store the data in that file. It later then send back to 2 arrays, for the customers to list in their shopping cart.

Since this is the first attempt, there might be erros related to the logic of the programming rather than the syntax and the program itself. 

The reference is from my Computer Science Class (CMPT135 - Introduction to Computer Programming II) 

The Subject in this Program may include: 
  - Class/Objects (OOP) 
  - Stream and FStream (read and write a textfile)
  - IF-Else and For/while Loops
